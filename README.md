# Occtane
Simple script that utilizes a headless browser (puppeteer) to scrape dynamic content from Occulus.com to check whether Rift S is out of stock

If a change is detected in the stock status element of the Occulus Rift S it will notify the user via email (Nodemailer).

The script is then packaged as an executable (pkg) for Windows users.
